# Context
This Decision Tree predicts if a mushroom is Edible or Poisonous.
This was a project in the course "Machine Learning" which I took in my second semester of my second year in my Computer Science degree in Reichman University.
All I used to create my code was Pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for visualizasion. 
All the calaculations and steps are explained.

Hope You Enjoy!
